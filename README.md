## Description
This is a game is quite fun because you can spin the dice
more than once to get a higher score than you previously had.
When you spin the dice and apparently get a 1, your score is zero
but you are allowed to spin once again. The first player to get
to 100 points is declared winner and a new game starts all over
again.
